# MojoPack

Welcome initiate.  You have been granted an exclusive lease to harvest resources from Planet X853.  Our scanners show that this planet is very rich in vegetation and minerals.  The advance team has constructed a mining base that has everything for you to get started.

This is a very special honor for a new initiate.  You will be expected to complete all of the order requisitions to justify granting you this lease.

----------------------------

Special Note About Quests
This is a quest driven pack, but the quests will not be redundent.  There won't be three different quests to build three different furnaces.  The quests will be to provide resources in bulk.  Some examples are a cache full of iron, a cache full of oak logs or a cache full of leather.  There will be some progressive quests through armor and tools.

Design Goals
- Only tech mods and quality of life mods.  Automation will be required to complete the quests.
- Start on a desolate planet that has no resources
- Start with a Void Ore Miner, Void Resource Miner, and Void Botanical Miner, and a solar generator.
- Quest rewards will be some form of currency that can be used to purchase useful items.
- There are no dimensions other than the overworld.
- Gating is controlled by the miners.  Some resources will required higher tiers of miners.
